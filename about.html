        <p class="para">As a student at Sri Krishna College of Technology, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics
          and Communication Engineering, with a keen interest in UI/UX design. I have completed multiple online courses on
          Coursera to enhance my skills in this field, such as Introduction to HTML, Introduction to the Internet of Things
          and Embedded Systems, and How to make invitations using Canva.
          
          I have also applied my UI/UX design skills to create engaging and user-friendly interfaces for various
          applications and projects, such as a smart home app, a health tracker app, and a social media app. I am passionate
          about solving problems and improving user experiences through design thinking and innovation. I aspire to become a
          professional UI/UX designer and work with leading companies and organizations in the future.
